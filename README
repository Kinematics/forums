This is a set of scripts for interacting with Web forums. The aim is to be
easily extensible and allow for using a similar API for any forum desired.

forum_archive is the library, which currently supports fetching threads from
implemented forums into a common data format. Metadata and post text are
extracted.

thread_story is a standalone program for compiling ebook files of stories
published as a series of separate posts. To run it, pass it the URL of a post
containing a table of contents, and a title. It will fetch and rectify the
contents, then allow you to edit them. After editing the contents as necessary,
quit the editor; the script will download all the chapters and compile them into
a single .html file. The format of the resulting file is such that Calibre will
successfully detect its structure for conversion, though the title and author
must still be set manually.
